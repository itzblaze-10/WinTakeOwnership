# WinTakeOwnership

WinTakeOwnership is a Windows registry script designed to add a "Take Ownership" option to the right-click context menu for files, folders, and drives. This utility streamlines permission management by allowing users to quickly assume ownership of objects without navigating through multiple system dialogs.

## Features

- **Quick Access:** Right-click on files, directories, or drives to instantly take ownership.
- **Optimized Commands:** Uses built-in Windows tools (`takeown` and `icacls`) with streamlined commands.
- **System Protection:** Excludes critical system directories (e.g., `C:\Windows`, `C:\Program Files`) to prevent accidental modifications.
- **PowerShell Integration:** Utilizes hidden PowerShell commands for a seamless user experience.

## Prerequisites

- Windows operating system (Windows 10 or later recommended)
- Administrative privileges to apply registry changes

## Installation

1. **Backup Your Registry:**  
   Always create a system restore point or back up your registry before making changes.

2. **Apply the Script:**  
   - Double-click the `.reg` file to merge it into your registry.
   - Alternatively, right-click the file and select "Merge" from the context menu.

3. **Usage:**  
   After applying the script, right-click on any file, folder, or drive (except for excluded system directories) and select **Take Ownership**. The script will execute the necessary commands to change the ownership and update permissions.

## How It Works

- **For Files:**  
  The script launches a hidden PowerShell window that executes a command to change ownership (`takeown`) and updates permissions (`icacls`).

- **For Directories:**  
  Similar to files, but with recursive commands ensuring all subdirectories and files are updated.

- **For Drives:**  
  Uses a similar approach to update the entire drive, excluding the root drive (`C:\`) for safety.

## Disclaimer

This script makes changes to your Windows registry. While it has been optimized for safety and ease of use, incorrect usage may result in system instability or unintended changes. **Always back up your registry and create a system restore point before proceeding.**
